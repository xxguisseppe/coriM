# coriM

Spatial interpolation is an advanced technique that allows for the
estimation of values at unknown locations using data from points where
the values are known. This methodology is widely used in meteorology to
predict temperatures in regions without observational data, relying on
measurements from nearby weather stations (Smith and Goodchild, 2017).
The representation generated by these calculations is commonly known as
a “statistical surface” (Jones et al., 2015). This **coriM** package is
designed to perform monthly interpolations using the Inverse Distance
Weighting (IDW) method, based on temperature records obtained from
various weather stations (López and Martínez, 2019).

## Installation

You can install the development version of **coriM** as follows

``` r
 devtools::install_github("xxguisseppe/coriM")
```

If you are prompted for the `rnaturalearth` and `MODIStsp` libraries,
they are installed as follows:

- rnaturalearth library:

``` r
 if (!requireNamespace("MODIStsp", quietly = TRUE))  devtools::install_github("ropensci/MODIStsp")
```

- MODIStsp library:

``` r
 if (!requireNamespace("rnaturalearth", quietly = TRUE))  devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearth")
 if (!requireNamespace("rnaturalearthdata", quietly = TRUE)) devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthdata")
 if (!requireNamespace("rnaturalearthhires", quietly = TRUE)) devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthhires")
```

## Example

The result of the examples produces two files in `TIF format` for the
selected region. In this case the example is based on the regional map
of Puno in Peru. The information is from the month of March 2010.

``` r
## Loading Library
 library(coriM)
```

It starts by loading the data for spatial interpolation.

``` r
## Load example data
 file <- loadData()

## Load function for IDW interpolation calculation
 idw_inter(dat = file, sta = TRUE, cntr="peru",coun_cd = 'PE', alt = TRUE, reg = "Puno")
```

In the same way, the example for the calculation of monthly average Land
Surface Temperature obtained from MODIS satellite is presented.

``` r
## Load function for MODIS LST monthly calculation
mod_lst (sen = "Aqua", usr = "own_user", pass = "own_password",
           bd = "2010.03.01", ed = "2010.03.31", mnth = "March",
           proj = 4326, cntr = "peru",sta = TRUE, reg = "Puno")
```
