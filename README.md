# coriM

Spatial interpolation is an advanced technique that allows for the
estimation of values at unknown locations using data from points where
the values are known. This methodology is widely used in meteorology to
predict temperatures in regions without observational data, relying on
measurements from nearby weather stations (Smith and Goodchild, 2017).
The representation generated by these calculations is commonly known as
a “statistical surface” (Jones et al., 2015). This **coriM** package is
designed to perform monthly interpolations using the Inverse Distance
Weighting (IDW) method, based on temperature records obtained from
various weather stations (López and Martínez, 2019).

## Installation

You can install the development version of **coriM** as follows

``` r
# devtools::install_github("xxguisseppe/coriM")
```

If you are prompted for the **rnaturalearth** and **MODIStsp**
libraries, they are installed as follows:

**rnaturalearth library**

``` r
# if (!requireNamespace("MODIStsp", quietly = TRUE))  devtools::install_github("ropensci/MODIStsp")
```

**MODIStsp library**

``` r
# if (!requireNamespace("rnaturalearth", quietly = TRUE))  devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearth")
# if (!requireNamespace("rnaturalearthdata", quietly = TRUE)) devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthdata")
# if (!requireNamespace("rnaturalearthhires", quietly = TRUE)) devtools::install_github("ropensci/rnaturalearthhires")
```

## Example

``` r
 library(coriM)
```

It starts by loading the data for spatial interpolation.

``` r
## Loading data
 file <- loadData()

## Inspect data
 idw_inter(dat = file, sta = TRUE, cntr="peru",coun_cd = 'PE', alt = TRUE, reg = "Puno")
```

In the same way, the example for the calculation of monthly average Land
Surface Temperature obtained from MODIS satellite is presented.

``` r
## MODIS LST 
mod_lst (sen = "Aqua", usr = "own_user", pass = "own_password",
           bd = "2010.03.01", ed = "2010.03.31", mnth = "March",
           proj = 4326, cntr = "peru",sta = TRUE, reg = "Puno")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
